# Whiskey Review Data Analysis

## Installations

 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 
No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in doing exploratory data analysis using a [Scotch whiskey reviews dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neilcosgrove/scotch-whiskey-reviews-update-2020) containing a listing of 2,247 reviews of Scotch whiskeys to answer the following questions:
 
 - Is the most premium whiskey bottled from a single cask ?
 - Is the strongest whiskey in the dataset (by ABV %) bottled at cask strength or was it watered down during bottling ?
 - What is the most prominent category among whiskeys that are highly rated (above 85 points)?
 - What category of whiskey usually commands higher price ?
 - Which whiskey is best bang for you buck when it comes to the highest rated whiskies (95 points and above) ??


## File Descriptions
- A jupyter notebook with markdown cells and comments added throughout to explain the process taken to gather, asses, clean,transform and analyze the whiskey reviews data.
- A csv file that contains the whiksey reviews data of 2247 scotch whiskeys along with their price points, review points, description , name and category
